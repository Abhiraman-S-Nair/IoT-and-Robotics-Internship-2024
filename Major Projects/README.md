# Major Projects

## - [Digital Dice ðŸŽ²](https://github.com/Abhiraman-S-Nair/IoT-and-Robotics-Internship-2024/tree/main/Major%20Projects/Digital%20Dice)
The Digital Dice project is an Arduino-based system designed to simulate the roll of a traditional dice. Using a 20x4 LCD display and a keypad for user input, it generates random numbers to emulate dice rolls and displays the results in real-time. This project showcases proficiency in user interface design, random number generation, and hardware integration with Arduino.

## - [Water Level Monitoring System ðŸ’§](https://github.com/Abhiraman-S-Nair/IoT-and-Robotics-Internship-2024/tree/main/Major%20Projects/Water%20Level%20Monitoring%20System)
The Water Level Monitoring System is an Arduino-based project aimed at monitoring water levels in tanks. It utilizes ultrasonic sensors to measure the water level and provides real-time feedback using an LCD display, RGB LED, and buzzer. This project demonstrates my proficiency in hardware integration and sensor interfacing.
