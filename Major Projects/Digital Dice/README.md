# Digital Dice üé≤

Welcome to the documentation for the Digital Dice project! This project aims to create a digital dice using Arduino and various components to simulate the roll of a traditional dice. Below is a comprehensive overview of the project, including its components, functionality, and implementation details.

## Overview ‚ÑπÔ∏è

The Digital Dice project is designed to provide a fun and interactive way of simulating the roll of a traditional dice using Arduino and a 20x4 LCD display. By incorporating a keypad for user input and random number generation, the project creates a seamless experience for rolling dice and displaying the results.

## Components Used üõ†Ô∏è

- Arduino Mega
- 20x4 LCD Display (I2C)
- Keypad
- Resistors
- Jumper Wires

## Functionality üöÄ

### User Interface
The project features a user-friendly interface displayed on the 20x4 LCD screen, providing prompts and options for users to interact with the digital dice.

### Random Number Generation
Upon user input, the Arduino generates random numbers to simulate the roll of a dice, ensuring unpredictability and fairness in the results.

### Dice Selection
Users can choose from various types of dice, including D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, and D20, using the keypad input.

### Result Display
The results of each dice roll are displayed on the LCD screen, providing users with immediate feedback and a visual representation of the outcome.

## Implementation üõ†Ô∏è

The project was implemented using Arduino programming language, with the LCD display and keypad interfaced with the Arduino Mega microcontroller. The code controls the user interface, random number generation, and result display to create a seamless and engaging experience for users.

## Future Enhancements üîÆ

- **Multiplayer Mode**: Implement multiplayer functionality to allow multiple users to roll dice simultaneously.
- **Custom Dice**: Add support for custom dice configurations and rules to cater to different gaming scenarios.
- **Score Tracking**: Integrate score tracking and statistics to enhance the gaming experience.

## Conclusion üéâ

The Digital Dice project successfully achieves its objective of providing a digital alternative to traditional dice rolling.
