# Minor Projects

## - [Digital Lock üîí](https://github.com/Abhiraman-S-Nair/IoT-and-Robotics-Internship-2024/tree/main/Minor%20Projects/Digital%20Lock)
The Digital Combination Lock project is an Arduino-based system designed to simulate a secure lock mechanism using a servo motor, keypad, and LCD display. By entering the correct password via the keypad, users can unlock the system, which triggers the servo motor to simulate unlocking. This project showcases proficiency in Arduino programming, hardware integration, and user interface design.

## - [Digital Measurement System üìè](https://github.com/Abhiraman-S-Nair/IoT-and-Robotics-Internship-2024/tree/main/Minor%20Projects/Digital%20Measurement%20System)
The Distance Measurement System is an Arduino-based project designed to measure distances using an ultrasonic sensor. It provides real-time feedback on the distance measured, displaying the results on an LCD screen and sounding a buzzer for proximity alerts. This project showcases my expertise in sensor integration and hardware interfacing, offering a practical solution for distance measurement applications.
