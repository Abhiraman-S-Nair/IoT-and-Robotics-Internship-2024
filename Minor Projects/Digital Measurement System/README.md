The Distance Measurement System is an Arduino-based project designed to measure distances using an ultrasonic sensor. It provides real-time feedback on the distance measured, displaying the results on an LCD screen and sounding a buzzer for proximity alerts. This project showcases my expertise in sensor integration and hardware interfacing, offering a practical solution for distance measurement applications.
