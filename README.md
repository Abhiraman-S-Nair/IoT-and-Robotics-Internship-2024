# Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my projects portfolio repository! This repository showcases my major and minor projects developed after learning various concepts of Robotics, IoT, and Arduino. The projects are organized into two sub-folders: Major and Minor, each containing detailed documentation and code for the respective projects.

## Major Projects

### - [Digital Dice 🎲](https://github.com/Abhiraman-S-Nair/IoT-and-Robotics-Internship-2024/tree/main/Major%20Projects/Digital%20Dice)
The Digital Dice project is an Arduino-based system designed to simulate the roll of a traditional dice. Using a 20x4 LCD display and a keypad for user input, it generates random numbers to emulate dice rolls and displays the results in real-time. This project showcases proficiency in user interface design, random number generation, and hardware integration with Arduino.

### - [Water Level Monitoring System 💧](https://github.com/Abhiraman-S-Nair/IoT-and-Robotics-Internship-2024/tree/main/Major%20Projects/Water%20Level%20Monitoring%20System)
The Water Level Monitoring System is an Arduino-based project aimed at monitoring water levels in tanks. It utilizes ultrasonic sensors to measure the water level and provides real-time feedback using an LCD display, RGB LED, and buzzer. This project demonstrates my proficiency in hardware integration and sensor interfacing.

### - [Digital Lock 🔒](https://github.com/Abhiraman-S-Nair/IoT-and-Robotics-Internship-2024/tree/main/Major%20Projects/Water%20Level%20Monitoring%20System)
The Digital Combination Lock project is an Arduino-based system designed to simulate a secure lock mechanism using a servo motor, keypad, and LCD display. By entering the correct password via the keypad, users can unlock the system, which triggers the servo motor to simulate unlocking. This project showcases proficiency in Arduino programming, hardware integration, and user interface design."
