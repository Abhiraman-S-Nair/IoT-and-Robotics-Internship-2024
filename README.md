# Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my projects portfolio repository! This repository showcases my major and minor projects developed after learning various concepts of Robotics, IoT, and Arduino. The projects are organized into two sub-folders: Major and Minor, each containing detailed documentation and code for the respective projects.

## Major Projects

### Water Level Monitoring System
The Water Level Monitoring System is an Arduino-based project aimed at monitoring water levels in tanks. It utilizes ultrasonic sensors to measure the water level and provides real-time feedback using an LCD display, LED bar graph, and buzzer. This project demonstrates my proficiency in hardware integration and sensor interfacing.
